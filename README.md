# Dot Desktop Helper (DD-Helper)

This is a really simple Python CLI tool to help you to create **.desktop** files.

## Requirements:

 - Python 3;
 - Tkinter (for the file dialog :D);

## How to execute:

    git clone https://github.com/PedroLucasMiguel/DD-Helper.git
    cd DD-Helper/src
    python app.py

## Features to implement in the future:

 - [ ] Add support for the user set more options to the file
 - [ ] Ask for to save the .desktop file directly on ~/.local/share/applications
 - [ ] Maybe create a flatpak package, just for the sake of it :D
